1. Introduction
This project is a functional web application designed to simulate a modern online marketplace. It consists of a landing page, a product catalog, and a secure user onboarding system. The goal was to create a responsive, user-friendly interface that adheres to modern web standards and Kenyan data privacy regulations.
2. System Architecture
The application is built using a Modular Frontend Architecture, where the structure, design, and logic are separated into dedicated files to ensure maintainability.
 * Structure (.html): Three distinct pages (Capstone, Products, and User Registration) provide a clear navigation flow.
 * Presentation (Style.css): A centralized stylesheet ensures visual consistency across all pages (colors, typography, and spacing).
 * Behavior (Script.js): Handles client-side interactivity, such as button clicks .
A. Product Management (Products.html)
This page serves as the inventory display. It is designed to be scalable, allowing for the addition of more product cards without breaking the layout.
B. Logic Layer (Script.js)
The JavaScript file acts as the "brain" of the project. It handles:
 * Event listeners for user navigation.
 * Input validation for the registration form.
3. Regulatory & Ethical Compliance 
 * Data Minimization: The registration form only asks for essential information, adhering to the Data Protection Act (2019) principles.
 * Transparency: The clear labeling of inputs ensures users know exactly what data they are providing.
